# get-recd 
is an app to build essential lists of music.  If you are a big fan of Nirvana, Stan Getz or anyone else, now you can share lists of your favorite albums.  Make sure friends and family don't go out and buy that ONE horrible album and have their opinions skewed forever.  Don't spend your holidays trying to convince them that 'REALLY, Frank Zappa is amazing. You just have to listen to the right album.'

Go into the record store with CONFIDENCE, using get rec'd as your guide
